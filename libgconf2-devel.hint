sdesc: "GNOME configuration database system (development)"
ldesc: "GConf is a configuration database system, functionally similar to the
Windows registry but lots better. It's being written for the GNOME
desktop but does not require GNOME; configure should notice if GNOME
is not installed and compile the basic GConf library anyway."
